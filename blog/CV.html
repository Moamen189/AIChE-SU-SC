				-Resume is a writing document of work experience education and skills.<br>

-Only one or two pages long.<br>

-And give a short but detailed description of your past job duties and experiences. <br>

-Employers often need to read many resumes so they look for keywords.<br>

-Why do you need a resume? Because there is a lot of competitions in the job market, job seekers need to create a resume that really show their qualifications to an employer.<br>

			   </span>
			    <h3>A great resume is very important for 3 reasons:</h3><br><br>

<h4>1-A great resume will get the attention of the employers and show why you are a good match for the job.</h4><br>
<p class="articles"> (Employers will read many resumes from many different applicants. So, you need to make sure that your resume clearly stands out to get the attention of the employer. Remember that your qualifications should match the job advertisement. If the company is looking for someone with five years of sales experience, you should have five years, or more, of sales experience, and say that clearly in your resume.)
</p>
<br>



<h4>2-You need a great resume is that it communicates your strongest skills and accomplishments to a future employer. </h4><br>
<p class="articles">. (Your resume should highlight the skills that employers often look for, such as technology skills and communication skills. Your resume should also include professional accomplishments or activities. For example, if you wrote a book that was published, you should put that in your resume.)
</p><br>


<h4>3-You should need a great resume is that it gets you an interview. </h4><br>
<p class="articles">(Your resume is your first chance to get the employer attention. Job seekers want to leave the reader with a positive first impression or a good feeling. If the employer likes what they read they will contact you to interview for the job. The interview is your chance to meet the employer in person and give more details about your qualifications.)
</p><br>

  <h3>A sample one-page resume. </h3><br>
<p class="articles">
	Some resumes are much longer than one page. But, for our purposes, we are going to stick with a one-page version.
</p><br>
<img class="resonsive" src="img/RR.png">
<p class="articles">
	In this sample, I hope you can see how the writer has used lots of white space, bullet points, and a limited number of fonts so the resume is much easier to read.
</p><br> 
<img class="resonsive" src="img/YY.png">

<h3>the first thing you can do is make sure that your resume has each of the following key parts.
</h3><br>
<p class="articles">
	Your name and contact details. If an employer wants to contact you to ask you to come for an interview, here is where they will find your full name and information about how they can communicate with you, like your email address or telephone number</p><br> 
	<p class="articles">
	The headline and summary. This section is where you should write the job you are looking for and then include a summary of the skills you have. 
</p><br> 
<p class="articles">
	The work experiences. Here, you can list the jobs you have worked at in the past, including your current job, if you have one. Current job means what job you have now. Be sure to list your work experience in reverse chronological order. In other words, list your most recent job first, the one before that next, and so on into the past.
</p><br> 
	<p class="articles">
	The high school or college degrees you received and the year you received them.
</p><br> 


<h3>The Basic Parts</h3><br>
<h4>Select the Best Format</h4><br>
<p class="articles">
	Different resume types highlight different types of experience. Before you start writing, think about what format you want to use. Choose the one that shows your skills in the best way.<br>
There are two basic resume formats. One is chronological. The other is functional. 
<br>
<p class="articles">
	-Chronological resumes highlight your job history. They list your past work experiences. A chronological format works best if you have a strong work history. It is a good format when you are looking for a new job in the same field. It shows how your past experience will help with a new job.
</p>
<p class="articles">
	-Functional resumes focus less on experience and more on skills. A functional format shows what you are able to do. This format helps to show skills that are not part of your work history. It is the best format to use if you are changing careers.

</p>
<p>The best resumes are usually a mix of both formats. They give employers important information about your work history. And they also show your strongest skills.
</p><br>


<h4>The first part of a resume: Your name and contact information.
</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">
Your resume needs to clearly show your full name. This means that you write your given name first followed by your family name. If you have a middle name, you can write it out completely or just use the first letter. For example, Sally Ann Smith could write her name two ways. Sally Ann Smith. Or, Sally A Smith.<br>
job seekers will make their name a larger size, or font, than the rest of the words. This helps the employer, or the reader to find the name very quickly. It is also common to put the name in the center at the top of the page. Another way to make the name stand out is to write it in bold letters which are darker than the other letters.<br>
The next part is for job seekers to write their contact information. Which means their current postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. The postal address is your official location where an employer can send you information. Your postal address is your house number, street name, city, state or province, country and postal code or number.<br>
Your e-mail address should be professional and contain your full name or at least a part of your name. For example, Sally Smith's email could look like this, sallysmith@email.com or ssmith@email.com. It is easier for a possible employer to contact you if your email address is similar to your name. For instance, flowergirl123@email.com does not appear to be professional or make it easy for the employer to remember Sally's name.<br>
For telephone number, you should include at least one number for an employer to call you for an interview. Sometimes job seekers provide a mobile number and a home telephone number<br>
</p>
<h4>Use keywords effectively.</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">
"Keywords" are the words you type to find information.
Your resume is a list of the jobs you have had. Companies use certain keywords to say what they want in a new worker. It is important to use these same keywords in your resume. You should use them in your resume because they:
<ul>Show that you might be good for the job. It is very important to use keywords no matter what. Use them on the paper copy of your resume. Also use them in the online resume you post to websites.
</ul> 
<ul>Make your resume more believable. Name software, like Microsoft Office. This is better than saying "strong computer skills" because it gives more information.
</ul> 
<ul>Show that you are part of the team. You should “speak the language” of people in the job you want. It makes you sound like someone who belongs on the team.
</ul> 
</p>

<h4>Examples of Keywords</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">
"Keywords are like the special language of a job field. Here are examples of keywords that might come up in a posting for a sales job. They are in bold:
<ul>-Name/Title of the job (sales assistant – retail)</ul> 
<ul>-What they need done (sales order processing)</ul> 
<ul>-Responsible for (analyze sales order data)</ul> 
<ul>-Skills (strong analytical skills)</ul> 
<ul>-Degrees (associate degree in business)</ul> 
<ul>-Computer skills (SAP Sales)</ul> 
<ul>-Companies (Google)</ul> 

</p>

<h4>Finding Keywords for Your Resume</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">
You can find great keywords in the posting of the job you want. You can also find keywords on job websites. Write down words you read often on job websites. You can add some of these keywords to your resume later.
</p>

<h4>Putting Keywords into Your Resume</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">
You should use keywords in your list of past jobs. This will help you explain your skills in the company's words. They can still be used all over the resume. Look at how the person uses keywords in the example resume.
</p>

<h4>The headline and summary section of your resume.</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">The headline is a phrase that highlights your value as a candidate for the position you're applying for. 
</p>
<ul>-It is often the job title, which you want.</ul> 
<ul>-It should be short and specific</ul> 
<ul>-Avoid making it too general</ul> 

<p class="articles">
The summary is a short paragraph where you can list your strengths and experience making you a better candidate often the summary is followed by a series of bullet points listing your key skills.
</p>

<h4>Work experience section of your resume.</h4> <br>
<p class="articles">In this part of the resume, job seekers list job titles, their current and former employer names, locations, dates of employment, and a brief description of the job duties they had. Some job seekers call this part, experience, so that they can include volunteer work in addition to paid jobs. No matter what you call it, this section of your resume is the part that future employers focus on most to decide if a candidate is a good match for the position. It is important that job seekers are honest in the description of their duties because hiring officials often check with past employers. Because a resume is only one or two pages long, it may not be possible to list all of your experiences. You will need to choose the ones that best show your skills for the job. Job seekers list their experience in reverse chronological order. This means they start with their current or most recent job, then the list continuous backwards by time order. Each entry is separate, but contains all of the following information, job title, employer name, location, dates of employment, and a brief description of the job duties.
</p>
<ul>-Use a bullet list of three to five lines.
</ul> 
<ul>-There is no punctuation at the end because these are not complete sentences.
</ul> 
<ul>-It is important to be as clear and detailed as possible, but in a small amount of space</ul> 

<p class="articles">
Remember that employers want to know how you are different from other candidates. Think about what you have done well in past experiences and include those details with strong verbs.
