			   	    <h2>Time Management Definition</h2> 
         			<p class="articles">Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between specific activities. Good time management enables you to work smarter -not harder- so that you get more done in less time, even when time is tight, and pressures are high. Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and causes stress.
			        </p>
			        <h2>What are time management skills?</h2> 
			        <p class="articles">Time management skills include a variety of skills that will help you manage your time well. Some of the most important time management skills include: </p>
			        <ul>
			          <li class="listt">Organization. </li>  
			          <p>Staying organized can help you maintain a clear picture of what you need to complete and when. Being well-organized might mean maintaining an up-to-date calendar, being able to locate certain documents easily, having a tidy environment and taking detailed, diligent notes. </p> 
			         
			          <li class="listt">Prioritization.</li>  
			          <p>Assessing each of your responsibilities for priority is key in being a good time manager. There are many ways to prioritize what you need to accomplish. You might decide to complete fast, simple items followed by longer, more involved ones. Alternatively, you might prioritize your tasks starting with the most time-sensitive, or a combination of both.</p>
			          
			          <li class="listt">Goal-setting.</li>  
			          <p>Setting goals is the first step to becoming a good time manager. Goal-setting allows you to clearly understand your end goal and what exactly you need to prioritize to accomplish it. Setting both short and long-term goals can lead to success in your career. </p>
			        
			          <li class="listt">Communication. </li>  
			          <p>Developing strong communication skills can allow you to make your plans and goals clear to people you work with. It also allows you to delegate, which lets you focus on completing the most important, relevant tasks that align with your goals. </p>
			           
			           <li class="listt">Planning.</li>  
			          <p>A fundamental part of time management is planning. Being efficient in planning out your day, meetings and how you will accomplish things will help you stick to your schedule. </p>
			           
			           <li class="listt">Delegation.</li>  
			          <p>Being a good time manager means only completing work that will help you and your company accomplish goals. While this skill is most often done by managers, you can also practice delegating tasks if you are managing a project. While it can often be difficult to say no when someone asks you to do something at work, it is important to practice having boundaries to manage your time well and ultimately accomplish your goals.
			          <li class="listt">Stress management.</li>  

			          <p>When practicing good time management, you should also be attentive to your mental health. Handling stress in a positive way can help you stay motivated and perform well when going through your schedule. You might do this by including small breaks throughout your day, or by rewarding yourself in small ways as you accomplish tasks. </p>
			        </ul>
			       	<p class="articles">Taking time to develop each of these skills will help you organize your daily work, whether you are in a job, searching for a job or trying to develop a new competency.  </p>
                    <h2>Benefits of Time Management</h2>
                    <p class="articles">The ability to manage your time effectively is important. Good time management leads to improved efficiency and productivity, less stress, and more success in life. Here are some benefits of managing time effectively:</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li class="listt">Stress relief  </li>
                            <p>Making and following a task schedule reduces anxiety. As you check off items on your to do list, you can see that you are making tangible progress. This helps you avoid feeling stressed out with worry about whether you are getting things done.
                            </p>
                         
                        <li class="listt"> More time </li> 
                            <p> Good time management gives you extra time to spend in your daily life. People who can time manage effectively enjoy having more time to spend on hobbies or other personal pursuits.
                            </p>
                        
                        <li class="listt">More opportunities </li> 
                            <p>
                                Managing time well leads to more opportunities and less time wasted on trivial activities. Good time management skills are key qualities that employers look for. The ability to prioritize and schedule work is extremely desirable for any organization.

                            </p>
                     
                        <li class="listt">Ability to realize goals </li> 
                            <p>Individuals who practice good time management can better achieve goals and objectives, and to do so in a shorter length of time.
                            </p>
                    
                     </ol>
                    <h2>Implications of Poor Time Management:</h2> 
                    <ol>
                    <p class="articles">Let's also consider the consequences of poor time management.</p>
                    <li class="listt"> Poor workflow</li>
                        <p>The inability to plan ahead and stick to goals means poor efficiency. For example, if there are several important tasks to complete, an effective plan would be to complete related tasks together or sequentially. However, if you don't plan ahead, you could end up having to jump back and forth, or backtrack, in doing your work. That translates to reduced efficiency and lower productivity.</p>
                    <li class="listt"> Wasted time</li>
                        <p>Poor time management results in wasted time. For example, by talking to friends on social media while doing an assignment, you are distracting yourself and wasting time</p>
                    <li class="listt"> Loss of control</li>
                        <p>By not knowing what the next task is, you suffer from loss of control of your life. That can contribute to higher stress levels and anxiety.</p>
                    <li class="listt"> Poor quality of work</li>
                        <p>Poor time management typically makes the quality of your work suffer. For example, having to rush to complete tasks at the last minute usually compromises quality.</p>
                    <li class="listt"> Poor reputation</li>
                        <p>If clients or your employer cannot rely on you to complete tasks in a timely manner, their expectations and perceptions of you are adversely affected. If a client cannot rely on you to get something done on time, they will likely take their business elsewhere.</p>
                    </ol>
                    
                    
                    <h2>How to improve time management skills:</h2> 
                   <li class="listt">  Set goals correctly</li>
<p>Set goals that are achievable and measurable. Use the SMART method when setting goals. Make sure the goals you set are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely.</p>
<li> Prioritize wisely</li>
<p>Prioritize tasks based on importance and urgency. For example, look at your daily tasks and determine which are:<p>
 
-Important and urgent: Do these tasks right away.<br />
-Important but not urgent: Decide when to do these tasks.<br />
-Urgent but not important: Delegate these tasks if possible.<br />
-Not urgent and not important: Set these aside to do later.</p>
   <br />
   
<li class="listt"> Set a time limit to complete a task</li>

<p>Setting time constraints for completing tasks helps you be more focused and efficient. Making the small extra effort to decide on how much time you need to allot for each task can also help you recognize potential problems before they arise. That way you can make plans for dealing with them.
For example, assume you need to write up five reviews in time for a meeting. However, you realize that you will only be able to get four of them done in the time remaining before the meeting. If you become aware of this fact well in advance, you may be able to easily delegate writing up one of the reviews to someone else. </p>

<li class="listt"> Take a break between </li>
<p>When doing a lot of tasks without a break, it is harder to stay focused and motivated. Allow some downtime between tasks to clear your head and refresh yourself. Consider grabbing a brief nap, going for a short walk, or meditating.</p>

<li class="listt">Organize yourself</li>
<p>Utilize your calendar for more long - term time management. Write down the deadlines for projects, or for tasks that are part of completing the overall project. Think about which days might be best to dedicate to specific tasks.</p> 

<li class="listt"> Remove non-essential tasks/activities</li>
<p>It is important to remove excess activities or tasks. Determine what is significant and what deserves your time. Removing non-essential tasks/activities frees up more of your time to be spent on genuinely important things.</p>

<li class="listt"> Plan ahead </li>
<p>Make sure you start every day with a clear idea of what you need to do what needs to get done THAT DAY. Consider making it a habit to, at the end of each workday, going ahead and writing out your to do list for the next workday. That way you can hit the ground running the next morning.</p>

<p class="articles">By following these tips, you can manage your time effectively taking advantage of all possible benefits, avoiding all consequences. And in the end: Do not forget that your time is money and from this perspective, all of us are equal. But there are differences so what is the reason!!</p>
