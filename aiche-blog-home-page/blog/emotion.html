			   	    <h2>Emotional Intelligence </h2> 
         			<p class="articles">Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize your emotions, understand what they're telling you, and realize how your emotions affect people around you. It also involves your perception of others: when you understand how they feel, this allows you to manage relationships more effectively.it also called Emotional intelligence (EI), emotional leadership (EL), emotional quotient (EQ) and emotional intelligence quotient (EIQ).
 </p>
			        <h2> Theory of Multiple Intelligence</h2> 
			        <p class="articles"> In 1983, Howard Gardner set The Theory of Multiple Intelligences which states that there are 9 types of intelligence included both interpersonal intelligence (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and intrapersonal intelligence (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).
			        </p>
			        
			        <h2> IQ Versus EQ</h2> 
			        <p class="articles"> IQ, is cognitive intelligence. This is the intelligence that people are generally most familiar with, as it is the type that is most often referred to when the word "intelligence" is used. It is also the type that is most often measured through testing and estimated through things like grade point average.
<br />EQ, is emotional intelligence, which is the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior .There are differing perspectives on whether EQ or IQ is more important. Those in the EQ camp say "A high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life.
 </p>
		
                    <h2> Characteristics of Emotional Intelligence</h2> 
                    <p class="articles">Daniel Goleman, an American psychologist in his book titled "Emotional Intelligence - Why It Can Matter More Than IQ ".framework of five elements that define emotional intelligence:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                     <li class="listt">Self-Awareness</li>
                     <li class="listt">Self-Regulation</li>
                     <li class="listt">Motivation</li>
                     <li class="listt">Empathy</li>
                     <li class="listt">Social Skills</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <ol>
                     <li class="listt">Self-Awareness</li>
                     <p class="para">People with high emotional intelligence are usually very. They understand their emotions, and because of this, they don't let their feelings rule them. They're confident - because they trust their intuition and don't let their emotions get out of control.
They're also willing to take an honest look at themselves. They know their strengths and weaknesses, and they work on these areas so they can perform better. Many people believe that this self-awareness is the most important part of emotional intelligence. 
</p>
                     
                     <li class="listt">Self-Regulation</li>
                                          <p class="para">This is the ability to control emotions  and impulses. People who self-regulate typically don't allow themselves to become too angry or jealous, and they don't make impulsive, careless decisions. They think before they act. Characteristics of self-regulation are thoughtfulness, comfort with change, integrity , and the ability to say no. 
</p>

                     <li class="listt">Motivation</li>
                                          <p class="para"> People with a high degree of emotional intelligence are usually motivated . They're willing to defer immediate results for long-term success. They're highly productive, love a challenge, and are very effective in whatever they do.
</p>

                     <li class="listt">Empathy</li>
                                          <p class="para">This is perhaps the second-most important element of emotional intelligence. Empathy  is the ability to identify with and understand the wants, needs, and viewpoints of those around you. People with empathy are good at recognizing the feelings of others, even when those feelings may not be obvious. As a result, empathetic people are usually excellent at managing relationships , listening , and relating to others. They avoid stereotyping and judging too quickly, and they live their lives in a very open, honest way.
</p>

                     <li class="listt">Social Skills</li>
                                          <p class="para">It's usually easy to talk to and like people with good social skills, another sign of high emotional intelligence. Those with strong social skills are typically team players. Rather than focus on their own success first, they help others develop and shine. They can manage disputes, are excellent communicators, and are masters at building and maintaining relationships.
</p>

                    </ol>

                   
                    <h2>How to Improve Your Emotional Intelligence </h2> 
<p class="articles">Emotional intelligence is a skill that we are born with, but we can develop it over time with a few simple steps that can be practiced:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="listt">Observe how you react to people</li>
<p class="para">Don't rush to judgment before you know all of the facts .Look honestly at how you think and interact with other people. Try to put yourself in their place , and be more open and accepting of their perspectives and needs.
</p>
 
<li class="listt">Look at your work environment.</li>

<p class="para">Humility can be a wonderful quality, and it doesn't mean that you're shy or lack self-confidence. When you practice humility, you say that you know what you did, and you can be quietly confident about it. Give others a chance to shine - put the focus on them, and don't worry too much about getting praise for yourself.
 </p>

<li class="listt"> Examine how you react to stressful situations </li>
<p class="para">Do you become upset every time there's a delay or something doesn't happen the way you want? Do you blame others or become angry at them, even when it's not their fault? The ability to stay calm and in control in difficult situations is highly valued in the business world and outside it. Keep your emotions under control when things go wrong.
</p>

<li class="listt">Take responsibility  for your actions.</li>
<p class="para">If you hurt someone's feelings, apologize  directly don't ignore what you did or avoid the person. People are usually more willing to forgive and forget if you make an honest attempt to make things right.
</p> 

<li class="listt">Examine how your actions will affect others </li>
<p class="para"> before you take those actions. If your decision will impact others, put yourself in their place. How will they feel if you do this? Then take the best decision for yourself and them.
.</p>
